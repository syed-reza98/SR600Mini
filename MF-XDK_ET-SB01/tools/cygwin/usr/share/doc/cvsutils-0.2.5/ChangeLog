	Version 0.2.4 released.

	* cvsu.pl (process_arg): Keep the whole revision of the entry,
	not just whether it's removed.  Rename %entries to %tstamp,

	more reliable than long text comparisons.

	* cvsu.pl: Purge list of unused variables.

	rules for "gnits".

2002-08-03  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* cvsu.pl (process_dir): Allow empty timestamp.  For all

2002-03-11  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	return.

2000-10-23  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>

	* cvsdiff.pl: Don't use -u0 for ChangeLog - it's incompatible
	with GNU patch. Use -u1 instead.

2000-10-15  Pavel Roskin  <proski@gnu.org>
