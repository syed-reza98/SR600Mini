The following output formats are {\itshape directly\/} supported by doxygen: 
\begin{DoxyDescription}
\item[{\bfseries HTML} ]Generated if {\ttfamily GENERATE\_\-HTML} is set to {\ttfamily YES} in the configuration file. 
\item[$\mbox{\LaTeX}$ ]Generated if {\ttfamily GENERATE\_\-LATEX} is set to {\ttfamily YES} in the configuration file. 
\item[{\bfseries Man pages} ]Generated if {\ttfamily GENERATE\_\-MAN} is set to {\ttfamily YES} in the configuration file. 
\item[{\bfseries RTF} ]Generated if {\ttfamily GENERATE\_\-RTF} is set to {\ttfamily YES} in the configuration file.

Note that the RTF output probably only looks nice with Microsoft's Word 97. If you have success with other programs, please let me know. 
\item[{\bfseries XML} ]Generated if {\ttfamily GENERATE\_\-XML} is set to {\ttfamily YES} in the configuration file.


\item[{\bfseries Qt Help Project (.qhp)} ]Generated if {\ttfamily GENERATE\_\-QHP} is set to {\ttfamily YES} in the configuration file. 
\end{DoxyDescription}

The following output formats are {\itshape indirectly\/} supported by doxygen: 
\begin{DoxyDescription}
\item[{\bfseries Compiled HTML Help} (a.k.a. Windows 98 help) ]Generated by Microsoft's HTML Help workshop from the HTML output if {\ttfamily GENERATE\_\-HTMLHELP} is set to {\ttfamily YES}. 
\item[{\bfseries Qt Compressed Help (.qch)} ]Generated by Qt's qhelpgenerator tool from the HTML output if {\ttfamily GENERATE\_\-QHP} is set to {\ttfamily YES}. 
\item[{\bfseries PostScript} ]Generated from the $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ output by running {\ttfamily make ps} in the output directory. For the best results {\ttfamily PDF\_\-HYPERLINKS} should be set to {\ttfamily NO}. 
\item[{\bfseries PDF} ]Generated from the $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ output by running {\ttfamily make pdf} in the output directory. To improve the PDF output, you typically would want to enable the use of {\ttfamily pdflatex} by setting \hyperlink{config_cfg_use_pdflatex}{USE\_\-PDFLATEX} to {\ttfamily YES} in the configuration file. In order to get hyperlinks in the PDF file you also need to enable \hyperlink{config_cfg_pdf_hyperlinks}{PDF\_\-HYPERLINKS}.
